# Youtube Chat Bot üìΩÔ∏è + ü§ñ + üó£Ô∏è + ‚úçÔ∏è
This is a youtube chatbot chrome extension that allows users to chat with a youtube video.

You can ask for:
* Summary of the video
* If a topic is covered in the video
* Explanations in easy words

# Conditions
* Video must have english subtitles (can be autogenerated)
* 20 questions / hour since this is a simple project
* If the bot can't answer based on youtube transcript, it says "I don't know."
* If it feels you're asking a question unrelated to the video, it says "Please ask questions about the video only."
* If you close the chat panel, the conversation will be lost. You must then refresh the page to get a new panel back.
* First message can take some time to get a response since the transcript for the video is being fetched and embdedded.
* Some times APIs and processes can randomly cause absurdly long times for reply (~ 1 minute). Just message again (assuming it's not the first message, in which case it just needs about 5s to reply and then usually 1-2s per reply).
